a shell script is an executable file that can carry out automated tasks for youruns sequentially

the first line of a shell script dictates the shell itself
so #!/bin/bash, this says it is a bash script
comments are indicated with #
commands echo, cp, grep, > output to file etc.
statements if, while, for etc. to put login in the code

should have executable permissions (eg. -rwx r-x r-x)
scripts always have to be called from an absolute path
eg. /home/userdir/script
or if you are in the folder can do ./script

start off with vi scriptname
i to insert, then start typing
or write locally and upload by ftp

remember to then set the executable permissions!
chmod a+x scriptname
