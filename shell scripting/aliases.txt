you can create aliases for common commands, like mini functions

alias ls="ls - al"
alias pl="pwd; ls"
alias tell="whoami; hostname; pwd"
alias dir="ls -l | grep ^d"
alias lmar="ls -l | grep Mar"
alias wpa="chmod a+w"
alias d="df -h | awk '{print \$6'} | cut -cl-4"

can then run the alias command and it will run the defined commands for you

so just run tell and that will run the full sequence

BUT alias only lasts for as long as the session
can store aliases as either User or Global
define user aliases in /home/user/.bashrc
define global aliases in /etc/bashrc
just type your alias def at the bottom of the file
would need to start a new session to see the difference
