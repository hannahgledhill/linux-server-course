Linux code is derived from unix
Unix is mostly used by Sun/Oracle, now used by Solaris
Linux is CenntOS, Ubuntu etc. open source 
Unix supports far fewer file systems (hardware/processor configuration)

vs windows:
linux doesn't need to rebooted, is ideal for multi-tasking without consuming loads of memory and is much more secure
