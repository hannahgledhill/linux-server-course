there are 3 redirects in linux:
stdin - standard input
stdout - standard output
stderr - standard error

STDOUT
by default when you run a command its output goes to the terminal
the output of a command can be routed to a file using the > or >> symbol

STDIN
input is used when feeding file contents to a file
eg. mail -s "Office memo" allusers@abc.com < memoletter
adds the contents of the memoletter file as an input to the mail command

STDERR 
if commands produce an error, we can log them somewhere rather than having them just stored on screen
errors have a file code of 2
so "<command> <options> <arguments> 2> <errorfile>" will log ONLY error outputs of the command to the error file
