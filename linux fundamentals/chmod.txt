file and directory permissions

there are 3 types of permissions: 
read (r)
write (w) 
execute (x) (running a program/script)

each permission can be controlled at 3 different levels:
u - user
g - group
o - other (everyone else)

doing ls -l 
might see rwxrwxrwx, this means every group has all 3 permissions
or rw-rw-r-- this means users can read and write, groups can read and write and other can
only read

chmod changes permissions

can remove specific permissions
eg. "chmod g-w <filename>"
removes the write permission from the group level

"chmod a-r <filename>"
removes read permission from ALL groups

"chmod u+rwx <filename>"
adds read, write and ex permissions to user

"chmod ugo+r <filename>"
adds the read permission to user, group and others

if a directory doesn't have the executable permission, people won't be able to open it!!!

NUMERIC MODE

0 - no permission ---
1 - execute only --x
2 - write only -w-
3 - execute and write -wx
4 - read only r--
5 - read and execute r-x
6 - read and write rw-
7 - read, write and execute rwx

numbers go in order of user, group, others

so 700 is user has rwx, groups and others have nothing
777 everybody has everything

"chmod 777 <filename>"

can google "online chmod calculator" where you can tick boxes and it will give you the code you need
