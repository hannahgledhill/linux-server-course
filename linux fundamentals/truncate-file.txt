can shrink or extend the size of a file to the specified size
NOT compressing - this will actually CHOP the file and you will lose
any chopped data

truncate -s 10 filename
truncates the file to 10 bytes

then could truncate -s 60 filename
will increase the file size to 60 bytes
generally adds a bunch of random @ characters at the end to make it bigger
