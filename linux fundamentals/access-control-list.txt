provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism, can give permissions
for any user or group to any disc resource

eg. don't want a user to be added to the root group but do want them to be able to
access a specific file that is owned by root
don't want ALL others to be able to read it, just this one specific user

setfacl
"setfacl -m u:<user>:<permission eg. rwx> <full file path>"

can give permission to a single file to a specific Group
"setfacl -m g:<group>:<permission eg. rwx> <full file path>"

use -Rm for recursive (m is for modify)

to remove a specific entry
"setfacl -x u:<user> <full file path>"

to remove all entries
"setfacl -b <full file path>"

can get full file paths with pwd

getfacl
gives information about existing permissions
"getfacl <filepath>"

NOTE need x permission to delete files, not just write
