vi editor

redirect with > or >>

echo > or >>

REDIRECTS

echo "hello world" > <filename>
adds the text hello world to the file
overwrites ENTIRE contents of file

echo "hello world" >> <filename>"
APPENDS the text to the file

cat <filename> reads content of the file

can output random things to files

like ls -ltr > fileinfo

rather than the displaying the result of ls -ltr in the console, will log it to fileinfo
really useful for logging!
can do "date >> filename" will append the current date time to the file!
