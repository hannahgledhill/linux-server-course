pipe is used by the shell to connect the output of one command directly to the input of 
another command

"command [arguments] | command2 [arguments]"

passes the standard output of command to command 2

eg. "ls -l | tee [filename]"

"ls -ltr | more"
more command gives the output of a file one page at a time
launches the MORE viewer, hit space to page, enter to come back

"ls -l | tail -1"
tail would give you the last n line(s) of the standard output
