TAR - puts a bunch of files into one .tar container but doesn't actually compress them
GZIP - compresses a file
gzip -d OR gunzip - uncompress a file

eg. put all files in home directory into 1 file

tar cvf filename.tar path
or can just be in the directory and do tar cvf filename.tar .
the . means tar everything in the current working directory

tar xvf filename.tar to extract everything into the current directory

gzip filename.tar will compress the file
gunzip filename.tar.zip will unzip and leave you with the tar
