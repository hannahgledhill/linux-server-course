operating systems generally change and improve the file system structure

/ is the root directory, equivalent to C: drive in windows

/boot contains the files used for boot loading, this is what the OS is looking for when it starts up
/root is not the same as the actual root (/), its like the home directory of the root user
/dev stores system devices (peripherals)
/etc is for configuration files -- back up files before changing them!
/bin is a shortcut to /usr/bin, stores everyday user commands (instructions for commands like cd pwd)
/sbin is a shortcut to /usr/sbin - stores system/filesystem commands
/opt is for third-party add-on applications (not part of the OS apps)
/proc used in create file for all the running processes, cleared on shut-down (like RAM)
/lib is shortcut to usr/lib, C programming library files attached to all the commands   strace -e open pwd tells you which libraries are used in a command
/tmp is for you to use for temporary files
/home is where user directories are located
/run stores system daemons - silent processes that run in the background, triggered automatically without interaction from user eg. running cron jobs, tracks process ID etc.
/mnt used to mount external filesystems like NFS
/media is used for cdroms, will run cds or virtual machine cd drives
opt where programs are running
sbin where commands and scripts are located
/var is where log files are located

cd changes directory
cd .. backs up one level
pwd prints the current working directory
ls lists all the files in the current working directory

ls -l

anything that starts with - is a file
anything that starts with d is a directory
l is a link
c is a special file or device file eg. peripherals 
s is a socket
p is a named pipe 
b is a block device
nothing is a regular text file

# of hard links - number of immediate sub-directories it has, its parent directories and itself

Month Day Time is the time of creation
