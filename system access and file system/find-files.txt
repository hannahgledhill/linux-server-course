find . -name "filename"
will search in the current directory (.), good to do from home directory, or can do from root
iterates over the file system to locate files

locate <filename>
uses a prebuilt database which must be regularly updated with updatedb (updated automatically every 
few hours by the OS), though it is much faster

NOTE if locate does not work, as root run "updatedb" and also make sure you have "mlocate" package installed
to check: rpm -qa | grep mlocate
to install: yum install mlocate
